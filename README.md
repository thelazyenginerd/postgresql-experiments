# Postgresql Experiments

A series of experiments with Postgresql that I am documenting so that I don't have to figure them out again, and thought that someone else may find them useful.

I mainly use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/machine/install-machine/) to run these setups cos I am too lazy to set them up on a Linux box.  I highly recommend using [Home Brew](http://brew.sh/) to install both Docker and Docker Compose.
